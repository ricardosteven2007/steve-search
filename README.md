# steve-search

A small search orchestrator that runs multiple search APIs (Tavily + Brave)
in parallel and selects the best answer.

## What this does
- Sends the same question to multiple search APIs
- Normalizes their outputs into the same format
- Picks the best result based on simple scoring rules
- Designed to be expandable (add more adapters easily)
